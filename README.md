Cherokee is a Quantum Circuit Simulator which is capable of simulating 5-qubit, 5 stage quantum circuits. Although it can simulate an n-qubit, m-stage quantum circuit, the GUI of the program doesn’t support such big quantum circuits yet. The word Cherokee refers to a Native American tribe indigenous to the Southeastern United States. The language spoken by the Cherokee people is itself called Cherokee. It is an Iroquoian language (Wikipedia, 2015), (Mooney, 2006). In addition, Cherokee also known as “Cherokee (Indian Love Song)” is a jazz standard written by Ray Noble published in 1938. Cherokee jazz is also featured in a recent movie, Whiplash, directed by Damien Chazelle in 2014.
